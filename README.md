# **Iris Dataset Analysis**

# Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning, widely used for classification tasks and exploratory data analysis. It contains information about three species of Iris flowers (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica) with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This repository demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques applied to the Iris dataset using Python.

# Dataset Details
1. Number of Samples: 150

2. Features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

3. Classes:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica
The dataset is balanced, with 50 samples for each species.

# Goals
- This project aims to:
 - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
 - Visualize relationships between features using matplotlib and seaborn.
 - Build and evaluate classification models to predict the species of Iris flowers.

#Contents
- The repository includes:
  - iris_analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis and modeling.
  - visualizations/: Plots and graphs illustrating feature relationships.
  - models/: Saved machine learning models.
